This is a changelog and will be updated whenever there is an update to the game

0.4.1 - Wandering + Combat - Date TBD:
  Ways to increase damage, health and other stats will come in the next update, which will probably intorduce the farming skill. Other skills will come after
  Added Enemy Rewards
  Added Health Regeneration and Health Regeneration Stat
  Added Dodge Chance Stat
  There are a total of 10 enemies, with different rewards and stats
  Fixed double percentage bug
  Added Combat
  Actually not 1.0.0, 1.0.0 will be the full release (there will still be updates after)
  Added Wandering (mostly, will still be updates later probably):
    You can now use the wander button, which has a base of 5 second cooldown
    every time you press it, it will roll a random number which will determine what happens
    You can either find nothing, find some resources, find special people, or find things to fight
    When you find resources while wandering, it is based on your current resources so its exponential
  Added new STATS, which are used when fighting things while wandering and also will be used in research, which will be implemented later
  Updated stats page to include new stats
  Fixed bug where farming is always unlocked
  Made Farm information update whenever you buy a farm
  Fixed bug where the farm wouldn't be unlocked when you loaded a save
  Fixed bug where all saves would be saved as integers instead of floats
  Added Armor and weapon display
  Added Damage Reduction, Attack Speed, and Attack Damage display
  Added Enemy Health, Health Bar, and Name Display

0.3.0 - 7/13/2020:
  Changed price multiplier of buildings from 1.25 to 1.1
  Added TimesWandered stat
  Added Playtime stat
  Added Version stat
  made all stats actually update (only playtime and timeswandered update right now because there is no way to inrcrease skill level)
  Made playtime stat show up as hours, minutes, and seconds instead of just a really big seconds number
  Changed the version numbers because they were wrong
  Next update will probably be 1.0.0, and it should have wandering implemented (not fully because there will probably be a lot more updates later), and maybe skills implemented but that probably will come later, one at a time in minor updates

0.2.5.0 - 7/12/2020:
  Forgot some things in last update so here they Are
  put line breaks in between skills in stats page
  Added some stuff to the 0.0.1 changelog because it wasn't complete
  made it so scavenge cooldown bar immediately starts moving instead of waiting 2.5 seconds
  Just a tiny little update, basically no new features but I like to put everything I do here

0.2.0 - 7/12/2020:
  Made farm button actually do something
  Farms unlock the farming tab
  Text now cuts off at bottom of screen before it overlaps with the buttons
  Changed the farm info box a bit to include the amount of farms
  Did some more optimization to make future updates easier
  Fixed tabs (before they were off the page but they had nothing so you couldn't tell)
  Added Wander button, no functionality
  Added wander button cooldown bar, button activates animation (the animation took way too long to make), doesn't do anything else
  Added farming tab
  Added Stats tab
  Updated Stats tab to include skills, will add other stats later
